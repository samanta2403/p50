  <br>  <h4>
  Thomas Alva Edison, born in Ohio on February 11, 1847, was one of the most well-known inventors of all time. 

Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor.
  </br>
  </br>

He has invented the bulb. In the period from 1878 to 1880 Edison and his associates worked on at least three thousand different theories to develop an efficient incandescent lamp. 
<br/> <br/>
Three factors in combination are generally recognized as contributing to Edison’s success:
<br/><br/>
A durable incandescent material
  <br/>
Elimination of air from the bulb-a better vacuum
  <br/>
A filament material of high resistance
